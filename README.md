# Hashtable

This project focuses specifically on hash tables. I implemented a HashTable class with two nontrivially different hash functions. My goal was to minimize the number of collisions in the hash table.
While Java and other languages all have built-in implementations of hash tables, I was required to write my own HashTable class and hash functions.
